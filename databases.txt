MySQL versus MariaDB

MySQL refers to an open-sourced relational database management system
distributed by the Oracle Corporation, but it has different flavors. One
version, MySQL Community Edition, is a free edition of smaller capacity
that is supported by a large community of developers, but enterprise editions
in which fees are charged do exist for meeting specific business needs. The
community edition doesn't contain additional modules that may meet business
requirements, such as monitoring, security, and auditing capabilities, or
additional tools and support. Finally, the Enterprise version likely is
updated with bug fixes on a more regular basis.

MariaDB is also a relational DB management system, and it is derived directly
from the MySQL source (as a downstream product), but the developer who created
it has meant MariaDB to remain entirely free of charge and corporate control.
Because is is written directly from the original MySQL code, MariaDB is
interchangeable with MySQL in that it can replace the upstream original product
and continue to run virtually identical in operation and management.

I would choose to use MariaDB to support the idea of it being wholly free in
distribution. Unlike any corporate control of a product, all of MariaDB's code
is completely open for any developer to see, which translated into transparency
of intent and encouraging discussion for the community supporting this system.
This also means that any bugs that arise can be worked on by many code
contributors, fixes are derived from open discussion and testing, and
documentation freely shared in an unrestricted manner.
