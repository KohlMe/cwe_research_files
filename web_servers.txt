Apache versus NGINX

The reason I choose Apache is that this platform includes the ability to
control the server request behavior through .htaccess files, whereas NGINX
does away with this control mechanism. It does this for the ability to
answer server requests at a greater rate per second than Apache. I know that
not having to read .htaccess files for each request makes NGINX faster, but
I believe Apache's speed is plenty for my purposes. Instead, I value the
ability to set up how someone accesses my site and server files with controls
that are read on each request, which .htaccess files allows. Specific controls
would be URL rewriting, authentication and authorization of directory access,
and blocking users per IP address or domain.

Additionally, Apache is so common, that the community is large and support
materials and discussion boards are plentiful. Although there is no official
support for the Apache HTTP server, there are mailing lists I can subscribe
to for announcements about updates, and for support, such as the user mailing
list.
